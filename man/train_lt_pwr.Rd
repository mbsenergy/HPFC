\title{Train Long-Term Power Model}
\usage{
train_lt_pwr(pwr_data, ric_pwr, gas_history, pwr_holidays)
}
\arguments{
\item{pwr_data}{A data.table containing processed power data.}

\item{ric_pwr}{A unique identifier (RIC) for the power data.}

\item{gas_history}{A data.table containing historical gas prices (must include \code{date} and \code{value} columns).}

\item{pwr_holidays}{A data.table containing holiday effects for power modeling (must include \code{date}).}
}
\value{
A data.table with the trained power model results, including computed regressors and gas dependencies.
}
\description{
This function trains a long-term (LT) power model by computing regressors, incorporating gas price data,
merging holiday effects, and fitting the model.
